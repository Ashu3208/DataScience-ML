    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves the use of quantitative methods to gather, summarize, and analyze data in order to make inferences and draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. Statistics is used in a wide range of fields, including science, social science, business, engineering, and medicine, among others. It can be used to answer questions, test hypotheses, and make predictions, and it is an important tool for making informed decisions based on data."

    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are used to describe and summarize data. They include measures of central tendency, such as mean, median, and mode, which provide information about the average or typical value in a set of data. Descriptive statistics also include measures of dispersion, such as standard deviation, variance, and range, which describe how spread out the data is. For example, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the grades of students in a class by calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation of their scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics are used to make inferences or predictions about a larger population based on a smaller sample of data. They involve using probability theory and statistical inference to draw conclusions about the population. Inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis, among others. For example, inferential statistics can be used to determine whether a new drug is effective by comparing the results of a clinical trial to a control group, and making inferences about the effectiveness of the drug for the larger population of people who might take it."

Using the wrong statistical technique or measure can lead to incorrect conclusions and misinterpretation of data.\n",

The study collects data on the change in blood pressure (measured in mmHg) before and after treatment. The level of measurement for the change in blood pressure is interval, as it has equal intervals between values but no true zero point.\n",

Descriptive statistics are used to describe or summarize the characteristics of a dataset, such as its central tendency, dispersion, and shape. Examples of descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and histograms. Descriptive statistics can be used to understand the properties of a dataset, such as its distribution, spread, and skewness, and to make inferences about the population based on the sample data.\n",

Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses or to make predictions about a population using sample data. Examples of inferential statistics include t-tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics can be used to determine whether an observed effect in a sample is likely to be a true effect in the population or to test whether two groups are different from each other.\n",

    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of the average deviation or distance from the mean. It measures how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean.
