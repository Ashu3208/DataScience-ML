    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of the data by finding the most important features that explain the variance in the data. Anomalies can be identified as data points that deviate significantly from the projected distribution of the data in the reduced feature space.\n",

    "Autoencoders: Autoencoders are neural networks that learn to encode and decode the input data. Anomalies can be identified as data points that cannot be accurately reconstructed by the autoencoder.\n",

It can identify anomalies that may not be obvious or easily detectable by humans.
