    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, started working on the language in December 1989 while he was at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. The language was initially designed to be a successor to the ABC language, with a focus on code readability, simplicity, and ease of use."
